# Banks-Stocks---Financial-Data-Analysis
In this data project i focused on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. I worked on bank stocks and their progress throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

I used stock information for the following banks:

Bank of America
CitiGroup
Goldman Sachs
JPMorgan Chase
Morgan Stanley
Wells Fargo

and analyzed stocks performance over time from financial crisis upto 2016!
